##Data Searching 

**Chicago Crime**
<https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-One-year-prior-to-present/x2n5-8w5q> This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime that have occurred in the City of Chicago over the past year, minus the most recent seven days of data. We filtered this data by THEFT, NARCOTICS, BURGLARY, ROBBERY AND ASSAULT.  

**Austin Crime**
<https://data.austintexas.gov/Public-Safety/APD-Incident-Extract-YTD/b4y9-5x39> This dataset reflects reported incidents that have occurred in the City of Austin over the past year. 



When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
